## Principles

### 1. (Our guiding principle) The value of a company is not only in the profit it makes but also in the positive impact on people’s lives and leaving the planet in a better place than they found it.

### 2. Everything is a result of iteratation.

### 2. Make time, don’t find time.

At the beginning of all inefficiency is the time management paradox; there is no time to change to do it the right way because we are too busy doing things the wrong way. 
- If you do something once, get it done.
- If you do something twice, steal from the first time.
- If you do something thrice, automate it / template it / tool it

### 3. Strong opinions; weakly held.

### 4. Everything is an experiment.

At the end of the day we are telling stories about validation. Every piece of work not only delivers some kind of value, but also a means of gathering insight to iterate upon.

### 5. Anything + time = change.

### 7. In the end, it has to be about delivering some value to a person.

### 8. Success is finding the simple solution to a complex problem without simplifying it first.

### 9. Community counts.

At the end of every product is a person. As several people experience the same barriers to their wants and needs, they naturally discover a shared purpose. A shared purpose is the foundation of communities, and fostering them can lead to insight into the people behind the problems. The aim is to do this so well that you can anticipate the needs of people before they do.

### 10. Accessible design is just good design.

One of the primary reasons that accessibility has wider benefits than allowing people with disabilities to use your products is the curb-cut effect. Initially, dropped curbs were placed for wheelchair users but benefited people with push-chairs, bikes, and one less trip hazard. Extending this idea, taking different design elements and the overall language, and focusing on how inclusive and accessible they are, also helps to deliver a better user experience.

### 11. Documentation first.

As Chuffed seeks to be truly Global for talent and clients, it is essential to work asynchronously and collaboratively. Communication and work are in the form of documentation before any other, such as meetings, calls, standups, etc. All meetings need an agenda before anyone attends.

### 12. Purpose, Vision, Goals, and Success.

### 13. Ship small, ship fast, ship often.

### 14. Every process needs to have the same purpose; to make itself redundant.

### Meeting people where they are.
