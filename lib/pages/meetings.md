# Meetings

Part of collaboration is to communicate with your team members, but in a synchronous and group settings that is a meeting it can lead to being counterproductive. Therefore, for all meetings in Chuffed, whether internal or external, we aim to achieve the following:

## Internal

1. All meetings are to have an agenda with the following:
    - **Purpose**; why is this meeting needed.
    - **Takeaways**; what each person is expected to have after the meeting.
    - **Discussion Points**; Bring all questions and subjects up beforehand for people to prepare.
    - **Action Points**; To be completed thoroughout the meeting.
2.  Meetings are for discussion and furthering ideas, **not** decision-making and updates.
3. Stand-ups to be done async.
4. Reoccuring meetings need to purpose driven.
5. If you want a catchup, have a catchup, schedule a coffee-chat in work time at any time, for as many times as you want.
6. No-one is required to attend any meetings, or stay in meetings they are not contributing or taking value away from. It's your job leading the meeting to compel others to attend - see point 1.

## External
