# Live Rapid Prototype

## What is it?

The Live Rapid Prototype is a framework that helps to develop a small product as quickly as possible to validate larger pieces of work.

## What problem does this solve?
As a person looking to build a product over a long period of time, you need to know if and how your product will succeed. But that future is hard to predict because when there are no users, there are no insights or feedback into what will work. This leads to large amounts of risk as all decisions and tasks are built from speculations and assumptions. 

## How does it work?

In the main product development cycle, decisions are made for UX flow, UI elements, and feature functionality. By separating each decision into its component parts, a completely isolated piece of the product (different name, brand, design, etc.) can be created to feed back the information needed to make those decisions.

The components are the following:
1. The problem are you trying to solve.
2. The fundamental questions that need to be answered.
3. The persona’s attributes.

From this, formulate a solution that follows these rules:

1. The sole purpose of the Prototype is to gather insights.
2. The Prototype will deliver the value proposition in person.
3. Once the insights are gathered, the Prototype is deleted.

## Example

A Personal Development platform has a full product to build that will help users become a better version of themselves. This is done by delivering the task management tools used in SaaS to ordinary people.

### Problem

As a person looking to improve myself, I need to work on my personal development every day, but I don’t know what to do as the path is unclear. Therefore, I feel lost in my development.

### Questions
- Are people struggling to create tasks because they are not writing productive goals?
- Do people need task management to develop personally?
- Do people feel they need to work on their personal development every day?

### Persona 

**Motivations:** Career progression, improved skillset.

**Needs and wants:** Voice of authority, expertise in delivery, knowledge, employability.

**Activities:** Self-help books, seminars, productivity social media.

### Prototype
A solution that is a simple flow that asks users to define their bigger picture objective and assists them to use that to write daily tasks. This will be delivered in events focused on personal development.

## Why this works

This framework borrows from existing success stories. Taking something that solves a problem in a small and cheap way to answer basic questions can assist in building confidence for dedicating time to a larger intensive project.

In the world of mods, plugins, and add-ons for major products, only to see that functionality be adopted into the core product as validation has been achieved through small community successes. 

With people-driven endeavours turning into full apps, an email newsletter can cheaply validate for bigger work.
