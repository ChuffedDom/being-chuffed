# Project Management

The delivery of a project requires a set of skills that need to get an objective delivered. A project is defined as:

An endeavour by an individual or in calloboration that is broken down into a collection of tasks, with a deadline, that delivers value and achieves a goal in a measurable way, and therefore provides a benefit that wasn't available before.

note:
- With a deadline: Goals and Projects
- Without a deadline: Objectives and Initiatives
