# Personas

Every piece of work is a means of making something for someone; therefore, understanding the who behind the person is the only route to success.

Starting our work with a persona helps to define the scope moving forward. Even when we are unsure of attributes in the persona, the work can be scope to discover that information. 

For any new Product or venture, a speculative persona is a great way to start.

The ultimate aim, and question to continuously ask, is how truthful our persona is.

We assess that truthfulness through several means:
- User interviews
- Desktop research (the discovery of others)
- Analysis of the success of others
- Surveys and focus groups
- Expertise and knowledge in the field.

To get started, here are some prompts:
- Whenever we talk to a particular type of person, they often/always say ...
- Currently, people are completing a task or achieving a goal by [some activity], but it comes with too high a price, too much time, etc.
- People are using a solution but not the way it was intended to be used because ...

Build a persona using this template, and as you make assumptions, you can gauge confidence in the success of the work or what questions you need to ask.
